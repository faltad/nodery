Nodery
======
Nodery is a simple online memory game. It is intented for two players, but can host hundred of game simultaneously.

The goal was to practise and enjoy using the following technologies: 

    - Node.js: The server is running via node.js.
    - JQuery: On the client side, this library is used to simplify the code.


On the server side, no additonal framework is used.

The game was designed to work only with HTTP requests and without any socket.


You can find at the moment an example running on [sbrk.org:8888](http://sbrk.org:8888)

Or just launch it yourself with the command:

> node index.js
